Breadth First Search Algorithm:

- Form queue that initially contains the first node.
- Until queue is not empty or it is not the end node (node that we are searching for), check if first element is end node.
    - If first element is end node, do not do anything.
    - If first element is not end node, remove it from the queue and add all it's children 
        (if there is any if they are not visited) to the queue.
- If end node is found, search is successfully executed, otherwise search is a failure.
